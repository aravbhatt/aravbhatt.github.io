  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
    I got into coding in high school, but things really started to click in my second year of college — especially when I began building real tools. Recently, I developed an NBA game predictor powered by regression models and real-time stats.
  </p>
  <p>
    I’m especially interested in the future of AI — particularly agentic AI — and not just how it works, but how it’s actually being implemented to reshape the world. I’m excited by roles that bridge AI and software engineering to build systems that make an impact.
  </p>
  <p>
    Outside of tech, I’m a huge fan of the Bengals, Reds, Cavaliers, and Buckeyes. I bring that same competitive spirit to everything I work on.
