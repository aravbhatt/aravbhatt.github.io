  <h1>Arav Bhatt</h1>
  <p>Computer and Information Science student with experience in backend systems, cloud infrastructure, and applied machine learning.</p>

  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
    I am a Computer and Information Science major with hands-on experience in backend systems, cloud automation, and data-driven development.
  </p>
  <p>
    I started getting into programming in high school, but things really started clicking during college as I gained more experience through my classes and internships. Recently, I began building personal projects such as an NBA game predictor that uses regression models and live data.
  </p>
  <p>
    I am interested in the future of technology. One area that especially stands out to me is agentic AI. I am drawn not just to how it works, but to how it is already being implemented and how it will shape real-world applications.
  </p>
  <p>
    I am currently exploring roles that combine AI and software engineering to build scalable and meaningful systems.
  </p>
  <p>
    Outside of all this, I am a big fan of the Cincinnati Reds, Cincinnati Bengals, Cleveland Cavaliers, and Ohio State Buckeyes. I bring the same competitive energy and dedication I have for my teams to everything I work on.
